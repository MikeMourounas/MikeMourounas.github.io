				<p>
                    Hi, I'm Mike! 
                    <br><br>
                    I am a Computational Linguist at Vantage Labs LLC, focusing 
                    on Grammar Error Correction and Natural Language Understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    After receiving my BA in English and Modern Greek from Rutgers in 2012, 
                    I moved to Tyrol, Austria where I worked as an Au Pair and immersed 
                    myself in the German language. I quickly realized two things that would 
                    come to shape my future: (i) I am a terrible skiier, and (ii) I had a 
                    knack for language and a desire to understand the language faculty 
                    in greater depth.
                    <br><br>
                    I then moved to London to pursue post-graduate studies in Linguistics 
                    at University College London. I received my MA in 2015, and my PhD in 
                    2019. My research focused on the formal semantics of co-reference and 
                    the interfaces between semantics and morpho-syntax.
                    <br><br>
                    In August of 2019 I accepted my position at Vantage, and currently live 
                    in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. When I'm not languaging, I can often be 
                    found dabbling in website design with Django, practicing for my next 5k, 
                    or prepping for the odd D&D one-shot.
                    <br><br>
